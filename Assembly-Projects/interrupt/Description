in this project, I made 2 LED blinking (PA0 and PA1) with 500ms delay, enabled int0 interrupt and enabled int1 interrupt and set them as INPUTS,
int0 interrupt and int1 interrupt configured as in the falling edge generates an interrupt request,
when the int0 interrupt reads an interrupt request, PB0 is set as OUTPUT 1 and PB1 is set as OUTPUT 0,
when the int1 interrupt reads an interrupt request, PB0 is set as OUTPUT 0 and PB1 is set as OUTPUT 1.
