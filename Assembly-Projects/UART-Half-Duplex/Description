#THE HW COMPONENTS
In this project I used two microcontrollers to interface them together using UART PROTOCOL
the first MCU has 8 push buttons connected to PORTA which initialized as INPUT 
and the second one has 8 LEDs connected to PORTD which initialized as OUTPUT

#THE TARGET OF THE TASK
the target is to make a communication between the Microcontrollers using UART PROTOCOL
when any push button in the first MCU be pressed the equative LED in the second one will turned on
BY SENDING THE DATA IN THE 

#UPDATE
1- The first update is that I reduced the duplicate parts in the first MCU in the code 
and this caused some issues in timing To fix these problems, I started doing some Debuging techniques
like using THE VIRTUAL TERMINAL and THE OSCILLOSCOPE

2- The second update is that I replaced the main task of turned off the LEDs with NOP 
and instead after SBIC i put SBIS PINB, 2
